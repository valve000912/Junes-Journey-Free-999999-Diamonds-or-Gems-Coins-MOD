The role of Coins extends beyond mere acquisition. Players must strategically allocate their Coins to maximize the flower value of their island, which is crucial for unlocking new chapters and progressing through the story. Decorations and buildings vary in both cost and flower contribution, so balancing high-value items with more affordable options is essential for efficient island development. Coins are also used to purchase bushes that can be gifted to teammates and friends, reinforcing the game’s social elements. When space becomes limited or a player wishes to upgrade their island’s appearance, unwanted decorations can be sold for Coins, though only at half their original purchase price, encouraging thoughtful investment in each item.

Material exchange is another avenue for acquiring Coins. At Jack’s Deliveries, players can swap surplus materials for Coins, offering a way to convert excess resources into useful currency. For those in need of immediate funds, the Coin Shop allows players to purchase Coins with real money, providing a shortcut for those willing to invest financially in their progress. However, the game is designed so that diligent players can amass significant amounts of Coins through regular gameplay and strategic planning.

The interplay between Diamonds and Coins shapes the pacing and depth of June’s Journey. While Coins enable steady progress and customization, Diamonds offer shortcuts, exclusivity, and flexibility, especially in overcoming the game’s natural bottlenecks. Players who manage both currencies wisely can enjoy a smoother, more rewarding experience, unlocking new scenes, beautifying their island, and participating fully in the game’s social and competitive features.

 Diamonds, as the premium currency, are best reserved for speeding up timers, acquiring exclusive items, refilling Energy, and overcoming progression barriers. Their rarity makes them precious, and players are encouraged to use them strategically for maximum impact. Coins, on the other hand, are the workhorse currency, earned through regular play and used for purchasing decorations, buildings, and removing obstacles. They drive the core progression and customization systems, rewarding active and engaged play. Mastery of both currencies is essential for any player seeking to unravel the mysteries of June Parker’s world while crafting a unique and flourishing island estate.

June’s Journey: Hidden Objects – Complete Beginner’s Guide

June’s Journey: Hidden Objects is a popular mobile game that combines hidden object gameplay with a compelling narrative and island-building mechanics. Developed by Wooga, the game immerses players in a mystery-filled adventure set in the 1920s. As a beginner, understanding the core mechanics, strategies, and features will help you progress smoothly. This guide covers everything you need to know to get started.

Understanding the Basics

The game follows June Parker, a young woman investigating her sister’s murder. The story unfolds through hidden object scenes and dialogue sequences. Your primary tasks are finding hidden objects, solving mysteries, and restoring your family’s island. Each chapter consists of multiple scenes where you must locate items within a time limit. The faster and more accurately you find objects, the higher your score.

Gameplay Mechanics

Hidden object scenes are the heart of June’s Journey. You’ll be presented with a cluttered image and a list of items to find. Tapping the correct object removes it from the list. Some scenes are timed, while others are relaxed. Pay attention to item names, as some may be misleading (e.g., “horse” could refer to a toy or a statue). The game also includes “spot the difference” puzzles and memory challenges.

Energy System

Energy is required to play hidden object scenes. Each scene consumes energy, which regenerates over time or can be refilled using diamonds (the premium currency). Managing energy efficiently is crucial. Avoid wasting it on failed attempts, and take breaks while energy replenishes. Completing scenes and daily tasks also rewards energy, so stay active.

Star Progress and Story Advancement

To unlock new chapters, you need stars earned by completing scenes. Each scene offers up to five stars based on performance. Replaying scenes can help earn more stars if you didn’t max out initially. Stars are also used to upgrade buildings on your island, which unlocks new story segments. Focus on earning stars consistently to progress smoothly.


A fundamental pillar of advanced play in June’s Journey is the efficient management of energy, which dictates how many scenes you can play before needing to wait for a recharge. Since each hidden object scene consumes a fixed amount of energy, and the maximum energy cap is limited, advanced players must prioritize scenes that yield the greatest rewards. This includes focusing on high-XP scenes or those that contribute to event progress or club challenges.
